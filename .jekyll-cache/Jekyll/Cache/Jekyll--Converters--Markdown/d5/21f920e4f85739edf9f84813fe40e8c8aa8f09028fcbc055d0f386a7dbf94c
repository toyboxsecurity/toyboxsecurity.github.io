I"š<p>If youâ€™re feeling a bit more criminally inclined, play as a robber instead. Carefully choose your equipment loadout and case the house for valuables during the planning stage.<br />
  During the execution phase, you will steal as much loot as possible all while avoiding the kidsâ€™ traps until either the cops come, or the kid(s) defeat you.<br />
  You wouldnâ€™t let a kid beat you, though, right?</p>
